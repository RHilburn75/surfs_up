# Surfs_up Challenge - Module 9

## Data Sources
* Data Tools: Python toolkit (SQLAlchemy), pandas , numpy
* Software: SQLite, Flask ,Juyputer Notebook

## Overview of the Analysis
 W. Avy is pleased with our analysis.  However, more information on temperature trends before committing.  He would like to see temperature data for the months of June and December, to see if the shop can be sustainable year round. we'll use the our skills to provide the data he has requested.
## Results
 
 June Data
 
 * June data average temperatures in June average mid 70 degree temperatures.  With min lows in the mid 60's to max high's in the mid 80's, it would well benefit to have the shoppe in operation.  From the wide range of goods being sold during the "peak season", it could be very profitable.  The temperature are perfect!
 * Decemeber temperatures are also in line with good weather and temperature.  The min slightly dips to the mid 50's, but overall it is in line with December
 * While the temperatures are almost aligned, I would advise in keeping the surf shoppe open year round, but perhaps not sell or limit the sale of ice cream during the cooler timeframe
